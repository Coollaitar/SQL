| <p align="center"> Databases </p> |
| ------ |
| - We use `My SQL` software for SQL (Structured Query Language) |

| <p align="center"> SQL </p> |

| - Table Structure |
| - Requires a Schema (You should already know your database thorughly like how many columns and what the data includes) |
| - Great with Relationships |
| - Scales Vertically (Costly) |

| <p align="center"> NoSQL </p> |
| ------ |
| - Shiny and New |
| - Document Structure |
| - More Flexible to Changes |
| - Not Great with Complex Relationships |
| - Horizontally Scalable (Does not require powerful computer as compared to SQL) |
